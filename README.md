# Pihole Blocklist
<p>Ok, what is it? It's a list of domains/hosts which is involved in showing ads, track, spam, malware etc. Personally, I am using this list in pi-hole(https://pi-hole.net/) which is running on my Raspberry Pi 3 B+.</p>
<p>I made a program which runs every day once on my server. It collects data from a bunch of lists,  made them pi-hole ready(clean domain/host), make them unique & combine them into a single list and commit the list into this repository.</p>
<p>It's a lightweight list. So, it will take fewer resources. As I also block porn websites, a porn website/host list added too.</p>

<p>I tried to include popular & effective lists.</p>
<p>The porn list was already pi-hole ready but the domain was non www version. As a result, example.com blocked but www.example.com still accessible. So, I also include a www version of every domain in this list.</p>

### How to use?
  Just add the following list to your pi-hole.

  <code> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhhakim/pihole-blocklist/master/list.txt </code>
  
  <code> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhhakim/pihole-blocklist/master/porn.txt </code>
  <code> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rizwangaminations/pihole-blocklist/master/myList.txt </code> 
  
### Warning
  I included a few aggressive lists which can impact your regular internet browsing experience. I suggest you check the log query & whitelist the queries which case problem on regular browsing. All the facebook & twitter domains are blocked by default.
